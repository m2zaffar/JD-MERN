we only have presentation tasks which are below:

JAVASCRIPT 3 ( Operators, logical operators, switch) - PRESENTATION TASKS

Exercise (1)

→ Create a web page that asks the user to enter two numbers and displays
their sum and their product


Exercise (2)

→ What will be the output of the code below?
let a = 1, b = 1;
let c = ++a;
let d = c++;
alert(a);
alert(c); 
alert(d++);  

Exercise (3)

→ What will be the output of the following script:
alert(5 > 4); // ?
alert("apple" > "pineapple"); // ?
alert("2" > "12"); // ?
alert(undefined == null); // ?
alert(undefined === null); // ?
alert(null == " 0 "); // ?
alert(null === +"0"); // ?
→ Write down and then check your answer in the browser

Exercise (4)
→ Write the code which asks for a login with prompt
→ If the visitor enters “Admin“, then prompt for a password
→ If the input is an empty line or Esc – show “Canceled.”
→ If it’s another string – then show “I don’t know you”
→ The password is checked as follows:
→ If it equals “TheMaster”, then show “Welcome!”
→ Another string – show “Wrong password”
→ For an empty string or cancelled input, show “Canceled”
→ Hint: passing an empty input to a prompt returns an empty string ", while pressing
ESC during a prompt returns null

Exercise (5)

→ What the code below is going to output?
alert(null || 2 || undefined); // ?
alert(1 && null && 2); // ?
alert(null || 2 && 3 || 4); // ?
alert(!1 && !2 || 3); // ?

Exercise (6)

→ Create a web page that asks the user to enter a year, and prints whether this year is
a leap year
→ Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are
exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly
divisible by 400
→ For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but the years 1600
and 2000 were

Exercise (7)

→ Write the code using if..else which would correspond to the following switch:
switch (browser) {
case 'Edge':
alert("You've got the Edge!");
break;
case 'Chrome':
case 'Firefox':
case 'Safari':
case 'Opera':
alert('Okay we support these browsers too');
break;
default:
alert('We hope that this page looks ok!');
}
